      <h3>From Product Owner to Wedding Singer</h3>
      <p>My day job? Wrangling pixels and code as a Product Owner at iPaper, crafting the best digital catalog software for businesses. But wait, there's more!</p>
      <p>By night, I switch gears, belting out tunes and strumming my guitar as part of a dynamic wedding duo.  Music ignites a different creative spark, letting me connect with couples on their special day.</p>
      <p>Weekends are for conquering gravel. I'm a bike-building enthusiast, crafting the perfect machine for dusty trails and long hauls.  And let's not forget the long-distance runs that keep me grounded.
      <p>It might seem like a wild mix, but these passions share a common thread: creation, connection, and pushing limits.  Whether it's building a user-friendly platform, crafting an unforgettable performance, or tackling a challenging ride, each pursuit fuels my drive to innovate and make a difference.</p>
      <p>So, the next time you browse a stunning digital catalog, remember, the product owner behind it might also be serenading a happy couple or disappearing into a cloud of gravel dust.</p>
